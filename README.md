This repo is the result of the final prototype for the Unity [Create With Code Course](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code).
Unity Create With Code is an official course from Unity, where you learn to program your own projects from scratch in C#.

The objective of this prototype was to build a game where objects launch from the bottom of the screen. The player must slice the good objects while avoiding bad ones, and ensure no good objects fall off the screen.

üí° While not part of the course description, the gameplay is reminiscent of *Fruit Ninja*

## üåü Bonus Features
The bonus feature section was entirely optional, but highly recommended for anyone wishing to take their skills to a new level.
There are four bonus feature challenges ranging from easy to expert.

### [Easy] Lives UI
Create a "Lives" UI element that counts down by 1 when an object leaves the bottom of the screen and triggers Game Over when Lives reaches 0.

## üêû Known Bugs
- Objects sometimes collide off-screen, causing players to lose points unfairly.
- Objects may shift forward on the z-axis when colliding, preventing the mouse collider from registering hits.
